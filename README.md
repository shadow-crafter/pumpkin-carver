# Pumpkin Carver

This is a simple web game allowing you to carve a pumpkin, built with [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).

## Installation / Usage

Currently the app is not hosted anywhere yet, so you must do it yourself locally. Luckily, this is fairly simple.

1. Download npm.
2. Open the project directory, and run `npm install` which should install three.js and the packages.
3. Run the start command with `npm run dev`.

## Extra Info

This project is still very much a work in progress.
